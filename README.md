# AI Image Classifier and Streamlit Dashboard

This project involves creating an AI image classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that differentiates between AI-generated and real images. The classifier is integrated into a website/dashboard built with Streamlit. We used Selenium for data scraping and enhanced the training data using a Kaggle dataset.

## Project Structure

- *model_file.ipynb*: Python notebook containing the model training code.
- *modelfordashboard.h5*: Exported model used for the Streamlit dashboard.
- *index.py*: Streamlit dashboard code.
- *app.py*: Additional Streamlit dashboard code.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

- Keras
- Flask
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Basic libraries (requests, os, etc.)

### Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

sh
pip install keras flask numpy pandas


### Running the Model Training

To train the model, run the code in model_file.ipynb. This notebook contains all the necessary steps to train the CNN model on the dataset.

### Streamlit Dashboard

To launch the Streamlit dashboard:

1. Ensure the trained model (modelfordashboard.h5) is in the project directory.
2. Run the Streamlit application:

sh
streamlit run app.py


This will start the Streamlit server, and you can interact with the AI image classifier through the web interface.

### Data Scraping

We used Selenium for data scraping to gather initial training data. Ensure you have the necessary drivers installed for Selenium to function correctly.

### Enhancing Training Data

Additional training data was sourced from Kaggle to improve the model's performance. Ensure you have access to the Kaggle dataset used for training.

## Usage

1. Train the model using model_file.ipynb.
2. Export the trained model to modelfordashboard.h5.
3. Run the Streamlit dashboard with streamlit run app.py.
4. Use the web interface to classify images as AI-generated or real.
